# 576. Out of Boundary Paths

There is an `m x n` grid with a ball. The ball is initially at the position `[startRow, startColumn]`. You are allowed to move the ball to one of the four adjacent cells in the grid (possibly out of the grid crossing the grid boundary). You can apply **at most** `maxMove` moves to the ball.

Given the five integers `m`, `n`, `maxMove`, `startRow`, `startColumn`, return the number of paths to move the ball out of the grid boundary. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, maxMove = 2, startRow = 0, startColumn = 0
>
>**Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/out_of_boundary_paths_2.png)

>**Input:** m = 1, n = 3, maxMove = 3, startRow = 0, startColumn = 1
>
>**Output:** 12
 

**Constraints:**

 - `1 <= m, n <= 50`

 - `0 <= maxMove <= 50`

 - `0 <= startRow < m`

 - `0 <= startColumn < n`
